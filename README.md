# Pandas-Challenge

A project using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to assist the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

**Local Government Area (LGA) Summary**

Performed the necessary calculations and then created a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics in a DataFrame including following:
1. Total number of unique schools
2. Total students
3. Total budget
4. Average maths score
5. Average reading score
6. % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
7. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
8. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


**School Summary**

Performed the necessary calculations and then created a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school including following:
1. School name
2. School type
3. Total students
4. Total school budget
5. Per student budget
6. Average maths score
7. Average reading score
8. % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
9. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
10. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


**Additional**

- Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and displaying the top 5 rows.
- Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
- Performed the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.
- Created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.
- Created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
- Created four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending.
- created a DataFrame called spending_summary to include the following metrics in the table:
    Average maths score
    Average reading score
    % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
    % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)
- Created a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large)
- Created a new DataFrame to show school performance based on the "School Type"
