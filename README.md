# Pandas-Challenge: 

**Empowering Strategic Decision-Making with Data Insights**

Utilizing the power of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I spearheaded a transformative project aimed at assisting the school board and mayor in making informed strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. By harnessing data-driven analysis, I have drwan valuable insights into the educational landscape of the local government area (LGA).


**Local Government Area (LGA) Summary:**

Through rigorous calculations and meticulous data processing, I curated a comprehensive high-level snapshot of the LGA's key metrics. This included:

Total number of unique schools

Total student count

Overall budget allocation

Average mathematics scores

Average reading scores

Percentage of students passing mathematics

Percentage of students passing reading

Overall passing rate (students who passed both mathematics and reading)


**School Summary:**

Employing advanced data manipulation techniques, I crafted a detailed DataFrame that encapsulates vital metrics about each school, such as:

School name

School type

Total student count

Total school budget

Budget per student

Average mathematics scores

Average reading scores

Percentage of students passing mathematics

Percentage of students passing reading

Overall passing rate (students who passed both mathematics and reading)


**Additional Insights:**

In addition to the core analyses, I delved further into the data to uncover additional valuable insights. These include:

Identifying the top-performing schools based on the percentage of overall passing students, showcasing the top 5 schools in descending and ascending order.

Analyzing the average mathematics and reading scores for students in each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at every school.

Constructing a table that effectively breaks down school performance based on spending ranges per student. Four distinct spending bins were created, and the table, named "spending_summary," encompasses metrics such as average mathematics scores, average reading scores, percentage of students passing mathematics, percentage of students passing reading, and overall passing rate.

Developing a comprehensive "size_summary" DataFrame that categorizes schools into small, medium, or large based on their size, allowing for a detailed analysis of school performance within each category.

Unveiling school performance insights based on the "School Type" by creating a dedicated DataFrame that provides a holistic overview of how different school types fare in terms of various metrics.


**Report and Documentation:**

To ensure seamless comprehension and facilitate decision-making, I compiled all the analysis findings into a concise and professionally written report named "Written Report.docx."


**Resources:**

Throughout this project, I drew upon an array of reputable resources, including YouTube tutorials, w3schools, learnpython.com, geeksforgeeks.org, flexiple.com, and simplilearn.com. These sources bolstered my technical expertise and enriched the quality of my work.
